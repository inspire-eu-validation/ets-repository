Dear user,
we have recently created a new 'community space' on GitHub to be used as the unique place to interact with the community of the INSPIRE Reference Validator: https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator

Please open a ticket in this new space (from https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/issues/new/choose) to report a problem or bug of the Validator, to propose an improvement to the Validator, and to start a discussion about the Validator.

This new space will be the only one to be kept monitored in the future.
