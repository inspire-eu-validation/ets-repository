      <documentation>-- Name --
elevation property type value

-- Definition --
Enumeration type which determines the elevation property which has been measured or calculated.

-- Description --
NOTE 1  An elevation property is a vertically-constrained dimensional property of an element consisting of an absolute measure referenced to a well-defined surface which is commonly taken as origin (geoid, water level, etc.).

NOTE 2  It does not include relative elevations of the element referenced to other spatial objects.

EXAMPLE  Height, depth.</documentation>

      <enumeration value="height">
        <annotation>
          <documentation>-- Name --
height

-- Definition --
Elevation property measured along a plumb line in a direction opposite to Earth's gravity field (upwards).

-- Description --
NOTE This definition intentionally avoids making reference to complex geodetic terms. It is only intended to specify the direction in which the elevation property has been measured.</documentation>

-- Definition --
Elevation property measured along a plumb line in a direction coincident to Earth's gravity field (downwards).

-- Description --
NOTE This definition intentionally avoids making reference to complex geodetic terms. It is only intended to specify the direction in which the elevation property has been measured.</documentation>

digital terrain model

-- Definition --
Digital terrain model.

-- Description --
EXAMPLE Buildings, bridges or vegetation do not form part of a DTM.

NOTE 1 For DTM surfaces describing the floor of water bodies (e.g. the sea-floor), the water bodies are not considered as part of the Earth's bare surface. Hence, they are excluded from the DTM.

NOTE 2 For DTM surfaces in which any features placed on the Earth's bare surface have not been totally filtered and excluded, the deviations must be explained in the metadata.</documentation>

digital surface model

-- Definition --
Digital surface model.

-- Description --
EXAMPLE 1 Vegetation, buildings and bridges are examples of static features. 

EXAMPLE 2 Cars, trucks and other dynamic features are examples of temporary phenomena.

NOTE 1 For DSM surfaces describing the floor of water bodies (e.g. the sea-floor) and those features placed on it, the water bodies are not considered as part of the Earth's bare surface. Hence, they are excluded from the DSM.

NOTE 2 For DSM surfaces in which any temporary phenomena have not been totally filtered and excluded, the deviations must be explained in the metadata.</documentation>
